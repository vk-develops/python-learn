Problem Description:

You are given a positive integer r denoting the radius of a sphere as a parameter. Write a program to calculate the volume of the sphere. The volume of a sphere having radius R is given by (4 * Ï€ * R3) / 3.

NOTE: Return the volume of the sphere up to two decimal places. You can use round().

NOTE2: Use pi as 22/7 (not math.pi).

Sample Input:

1
8
Sample Output:

2145.52
